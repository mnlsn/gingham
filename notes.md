## Fibers
Fibers are the starting point of Gingham, the core building blocks. These can be basic HTML tags, like a button, input or heading tag. They can also be used to establish your typography, color palettes and animations. Fibers are not moved into AEM, they will remain in Gingham to be imported into Yarns.

## Yarns
We use Yarns to start spinning together the Fibers we've cultivated. These start weaving together the fibers of buttons, text, images and inputs to start creating components. The reusability of Yarns comes from it's basic cohesion of Fibers to allow multiple Fabric types to be created using separately styled Yarns. Yarns, if configured, will be moved to AEM as component HTL.

## Fabrics
Fabrics are created from groups of Yarn, a full-fledged experience of grouped Yarns styled to be visually different while maintaining the functionality each Yarn provides.
